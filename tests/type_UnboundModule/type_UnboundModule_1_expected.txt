Hint: your build rules might be missing a link. If you're using: 
 - Oasis: make sure you have `camlp4` under `BuildDepends` in your _oasis file.
 - ocamlbuild: make sure you have `-pkgs camlp4` in your build command.
 - ocamlc | ocamlopt: make sure you have `-I +camlp4` in your build command before the source files.
 - ocamlfind: make sure you have `-package camlp4 -linkpkg` in your build command.
